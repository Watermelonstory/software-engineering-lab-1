Software Engineering Lab 1
==========================

Tasks
-----

- Clone this repository.
- Modify the contributors.md file locally to add yourself to the list of contributors. 
- Commit this change.
- Push it to the main branch on Github.
- Observe that the file is updated on Github.
- Open index.html locally and explore the game.
- Make one visible or behavioral change to the game. This doesn't have to be a major change, but it can be.
- Commit your change. You may use multiple commits and/or branches if desired, but a single commit is fine for this project.
- Test your change locally. We do not want to push a broken game to others.
- Push your working change to Github. If you run into merge conflicts, feel free to attempt to resolve them. If you get stuck, we can talk more about how to get unstuck in class.
- Observe that your change is reflected in the [deployed version of the game](https://software-engineering-lab-1.netlify.app/) after a minute or so.

If Git is a little rusty for you, I recommend using the [Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for reference.
