- Make one visible or behavioral change to the game. This doesn't have to be a major change, but it can be.
- Commit your change and push it to the main branch.
- Observe that your change is reflected in the [deployed version of the game](https://software-engineering-lab-1.netlify.app/) after a minute or so.
